# Word Counter

This is a simple Python project that reads a file and prints out all the words from that file along with their frequency.

## Installation

1. In this example, replace 'example.pdf' with the path to your PDF file. 
2. The script:- 
a)opens the file 
b) creates a PDF reader object 
c) gets the number of pages 
d) loops through each page 
e) extracts the text from each page 
f) prints the text to the console. You can modify the script to extract specific information from the PDF file instead of just printing the text.
