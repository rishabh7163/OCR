# Introduction

This is a simple Python project that reads a pdf file and prints out all the words from that file.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/


## Usage

To run the project, you can simply run the following command:

python ocr.py

Note: Replace "example.pdf" with your pdf file name.

**pdf_file = fitz.open('path_to_file example.pdf')**

In the above line change **'path_to_file example.pdf'** to **your PDF file**.


## Process:
  a) Opens the file 
  b) Creates a PDF reader object 
  c) Gets the number of pages 
  d) Loops through each page
